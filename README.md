# Fishscript

Fishscript is a bash script which uses nmap to simplify scanning your router's gateway for connected devices and displaying extended information about any host of your choice.

## Requirements

nmap

## Features

Fishscript currently utilizes two respective functions- a thorough scan of all devices connected to your router's local gateway, which can then run a verbose report on information of an IP of your choice, and a port scanner which checks for any open ports on a given IP.

## Another disclaimer

Fishscript is, by no means, a polished or professional application. This is my first long-term extracurricular project and I don't have a ton of experience with writing bash scripts. It's probably not the prettiest or most efficient code, but this is a learning experience for me and it will (hopefully) improve as time goes on.
