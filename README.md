# Another disclaimer

Fishscript is, by no means, a polished or professional application. This is my first long-term extracurricular project and I don't have a ton of experience with writing bash scripts. It's probably not the prettiest or most efficient code, but this is a learning experience for me and it will (hopefully) improve as time goes on.
