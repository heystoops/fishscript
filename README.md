# Fishscript

Fishscript is a bash script which uses nmap to scan your router's gateway for connected devices and display extended information about any host of your choice.

## Requirements

nmap

## Features

Currently fishscript's main script performs a ping scan via nmap.
Fishscript prints all hosts on the local wifi network - and can then print more information on any one IP that the user inputs.

## Another disclaimer

Fishscript is, by no means, a polished or professional application. This is my first long-term extracurricular project and I don't have a ton of experience with writing bash scripts. It's probably not the prettiest or most efficient code, but this is a learning experience for me and it will (hopefully) improve as time goes on.
